Combinatorial Homology Modelling Tool.
This program is written entirely in Java using OpenJDK 1.7 and Java's SWING GUI toolkit.
External components used/required:
SCWRL4 (http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/scwrl4/) for the energy minimization of the generated PDB files. License must be obtained independently.
SFCheck (http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/sfcheck.html) for scoring each PDB against the CIF file. Custom binary provided with the package.

System requirements:
Processor   - at least Dual core or Hyperthreaded single core.
Software    - currently only supporting *nix system due to custom SFCheck module.
            - JVM 1.7 or higher required.
            - SCWRL4, SFCheck (see above)

Installation/execution:
    - Ensure SCWRL is installed, licensed and that you know where the SCWRL4 executable is located.
    - Unzip the package to your desired location.
    - Ensure that "CHModellingTool.jar" has execution permissions.
    - double click the jar file, or from a command line run.
